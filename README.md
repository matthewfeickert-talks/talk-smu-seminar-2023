# Towards differentiable physics analysis at the HL-LHC and beyond

Talk given at SMU as part of the 2023 seminar series on October 2nd, 2023.

**Abstract**

> With the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) era on the horizon for physics analysis at the LHC experiments there are multiple challenges to be overcome to efficiently analyze and extract the most scientific value from the unique and valuable data.
> In this seminar I will present a high-level overview of how applications of data science tools from the modern scientific open source community, techniques and applications from the field of automatic differentiation, and strategies for enabling analysis reuse can be leveraged to tackle physics analysis at the HL-LHC scale.
